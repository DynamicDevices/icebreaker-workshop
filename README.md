## iCEBreaker FPGA Workshop

Welcome to the iCEBreaker FPGA workshop repository.

This workshop is self directed and can be done on your own time.

## Supplies needed

* Computer

* [iCEBreaker](https://1bitsquared.com/products/icebreaker)
* [iCEBreaker 7Segment display](https://1bitsquared.com/products/pmod-7-segment-display)
  * You might need one or two displays depending on the workshop you choose.

## Toolchain installation

Follow the instructions on the [fomu-toolchain
README](https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-toolchain) to install the FPGA
toolchain on your computer.

## I am ready let's GO!

Now that you have all the supplies and the toolchain installed go ahead and
clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker-workshop.git
cd icebreaker-workshop/stopwatch
```

In the stopwatch directory you will find the workshop guide PDF. Follow the
instructions inside the PDF. If you happen to do the workshop as part of an
organized class the helpers are here to help you out when you have questions or
you get stuck somewhere. Do not hesitate to ask for help, this is why we are
here.

If you are doing the workshop on your own time and you want to share your
experiances or want to ask a question, [join our Discord
